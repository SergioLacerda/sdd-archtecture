## 🚀 Reading Flow Examples

### **Example 1: I want to add campaign search**

```
1. START: Read PATH for feature complexity
   → guides/onboarding/QUICK_START.md (3 min)
   → Decide: PATH B or C?

2. PRINCIPLES: Understand constraints
   → /EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/constitution.md § 1,3,6 (15 min)
   (Clean Architecture, Ports&Adapters, Performance)

3. ARCHITECTURE: Understand how search fits
   → /EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/specifications/architecture.md (10 min)

4. PROJECT: Understand campaign structure
   → /EXECUTION/spec/custom/rpg-narrative-server/SPECIALIZATIONS/constitution-rpg-specific.md (10 min)

5. IMPLEMENTATION: Design search
   → Create feature, follow principles
   → Write tests before code
   → Run compliance checks

6. COMMIT: Make changes
   → Pre-commit hooks validate
   → Push to PR
   → CI/CD validates
   → Review + merge

Total: 50 minutes reading + implementation time
```

### **Example 2: Bug fix in campaign isolation**

```
1. QUICK: Understand what to read
   → guides/onboarding/QUICK_START.md § PATH A (2 min)

2. BUG: Understand the issue
   → /EXECUTION/spec/custom/rpg-narrative-server/reality/limitations/known_issues.md (5 min)

3. RULES: Know hard constraints
   → /EXECUTION/spec/custom/rpg-narrative-server/SPECIALIZATIONS/ia-rules-rpg-specific.md § Campaign Isolation (10 min)

4. FIX: Implement fix
   → Fix code (quick, focused)

5. TEST: Verify fix
   → Run isolation tests
   → Run compliance checks

Total: 20 minutes reading + fix time
```

## ✅ Loading Optimization Checklist

When reading docs:

- [ ] Know your time budget (5, 15, 30, 60+ minutes)
- [ ] Know your role (backend, devops, PM, architect)
- [ ] Know your task (bug fix, feature, learning)
- [ ] Read ONLY what's relevant
- [ ] Use this index to navigate
- [ ] Skip CANONICAL if you understand principles
- [ ] Skip project specializations if not working on rpg-narrative-server
- [ ] Bookmark guides you'll use repeatedly
