## [3.0] — April 22, 2026

### ✨ Major Features

#### 🏗️ Governance Pipeline Architecture (COMPLETE)

**PHASE 1: Pipeline Builder** ✅
- Consolidated governance source files into 2 JSON structures
- **Core (immutable):** 4 governance items with `customizable=false`
- **Client (customizable):** 151 governance items with `customizable=true`
- SHA-256 fingerprinting with canonical JSON serialization
- Parsing support for: mandate.spec, guidelines.dsl, decisions/, rules/, guardrails/
- **Result:** governance-core.json + governance-client.json
- **Tests:** 13/13 passing

**PHASE 2: Governance Compiler** ✅
- Binary serialization of JSON structures to msgpack format
- Fingerprint preservation (not recalculation) for integrity validation
- Metadata generation with statistics (item counts, type distribution, criticality breakdown)
- Salt-based strategy: Core fingerprint embedded in client metadata
- **Outputs:** 2 msgpack files + 2 metadata JSONs
- **Result:** 4 compiled artifacts ready for runtime
- **Tests:** 15/15 passing

**PHASE 3: End-to-End Integration** ✅
- Orchestrated PHASE 1 + PHASE 2 execution with validation
- 8-point validation (file integrity, fingerprint preservation, salt strategy, separation, counts)
- Idempotence verification (same input → identical output)
- Roundtrip serialization testing (JSON ↔ msgpack)
- Data completeness validation (all 155 items preserved)
- **Tests:** 15/15 passing

**PHASE 4: Deployment** ✅
- Deployed compiled artifacts to `.sdd-wizard/compiled/`
- Backup management for existing files
- Deployment verification and checklist
- Manifest generation with deployment metadata
- **Outputs:** Copied to .sdd-wizard/compiled/ with backups
- **Tests:** 16/16 passing
- **Status:** ✅ Ready for wizard and agent runtime integration

#### 🔐 Security & Integrity

**Fingerprinting Strategy**
- Core fingerprint: `35efc54d3e353daaf633fad531562f1da97ec17814193b7ac44b2e9ef12daddd`
- Client fingerprint: `2247922049fc14d93c174fb22a584e5640f3d456980ef57107a4083187591e38`
- Salt strategy: Core fingerprint embedded in client metadata enables tampering detection
- Immutable core prevents unauthorized governance changes
- Customizable client allows organizational adaptation

**PHASE 5: Wizard Integration** ✅
- **Runtime Loader:** Load compiled msgpack artifacts from .sdd-wizard/
  * Deserialize and validate governance data
  * Provide governance data API for agents and wizards
  * Fingerprint validation and salt strategy verification
  * Item filtering by type, criticality, and customizability
  
- **Wizard Integrator:** Connect governance with setup wizard workflow
  * Integration hooks for custom wizard behavior
  * Governance-aware configuration generation
  * Customization template creation and validation
  * Agent-aware constitution configuration
  
- **Customization Templates:** Generate templates for governance customization
  * Basic, full, category-based, criticality-based, adoption-based templates
  * Support multiple customization workflows and adoption levels
  * 17 templates generated automatically
  * Template validation against immutable core
  
- **Wizard Orchestrator:** Coordinate complete wizard initialization
  * Load governance → Integrate with wizard → Generate templates
  * 7-step workflow validation
  * Deployment summary for wizard readiness
  * Ready for agent runtime integration

- **Result:** Governance data ready for wizard and agent use
- **Tests:** 41/41 passing (11 orchestrator + 30 integration tests)

#### 📊 Quality Metrics
- **Total Tests:** 100 passing (100% pass rate)
  - PHASE 1: 13 tests
  - PHASE 2: 15 tests
  - PHASE 3: 15 tests
  - PHASE 4: 16 tests
  - PHASE 5: 41 tests
- **Code Coverage:** All critical paths tested
- **Validation Points:** 7-point workflow validation + idempotence checks

#### 🎯 Architecture Pattern: 2-File Governance Model

```
Source Files (.sdd-core/) 
  ↓ [PHASE 1: Pipeline]
governance-core.json (4 items, immutable)
governance-client.json (151 items, customizable)
  ↓ [PHASE 2: Compiler]
msgpack binaries + metadata
  ↓ [PHASE 3: Integration]
Full pipeline validation (8 checks)
  ↓ [PHASE 4: Deployment]
.sdd-wizard/compiled/ (artifacts deployed)
  ↓ [PHASE 5: Wizard Integration]
Runtime loaders, integrators, templates
Ready for wizard and agent use
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Critical Improvements

#### 🟢 ULTRA-LITE Adoption Path (NEW)
- **5 core principles** — Minimum viable governance
- **3 essential rules** — Clear, simple constraints
- **5 DoD checkpoints** — What "done" means
- **5-minute setup** — Fastest entry point
- **Perfect for:** Solo developers, prototypes, MVPs, learning
- Upgrade to LITE anytime (10-minute migration)

#### 📊 Three-Tier Adoption Strategy
- **ULTRA-LITE** (5 min) — Solo/Prototype
- **LITE** (15 min) — Learning/Small team (< 5 people)
- **FULL** (40 min) — Production/Mission-critical

## Philosophy

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** — Breaking changes to core principles (unlikely, very rare)
- **MINOR** — New features, new adoption paths, documentation improvements (normal)
- **PATCH** — Bug fixes, small clarifications (frequent)

### Stability Promise

- **v2.x** is stable and production-ready
- All breaking changes will be in v3.0+ (not before Q4 2026)
- Early adopters can upgrade with confidence

### Release Frequency

- **v2.1 → v2.2:** Q2 2026 (metrics + multi-language planning)
- **v2.2 → v2.3:** Q3 2026 (refinements based on real data)
- **v3.0:** Q4 2026 (multi-language support launches)
