# 🎯 AI GOVERNANCE — Agent Initialization Protocol

**FOR ALL AGENTS: Read this file, then follow AGENT_HARNESS workflow**

This file tells you:
1. Where the SDD framework lives (check `.spec.config`)
2. What rules you must follow (read `.spec.config` → framework → rules)
3. How to work (follow 7-phase AGENT_HARNESS workflow)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Find the framework
```bash
cat .spec.config | grep spec_path
# Returns: spec_path = ../sdd-archtecture (or your path)
```

### 2. Read entry point
Framework is at: `{spec_path}/EXECUTION/_START_HERE.md`

Use that to understand:
- What you need to learn
- 7-phase workflow
- Where to find rules

### 3. Begin PHASE 1
Read rules: `{spec_path}/EXECUTION/docs/ia/CANONICAL/rules/`
- constitution.md
- ia-rules.md

### 4. Follow AGENT_HARNESS
7 phases of development workflow (see `.spec.config` framework for full guide)
