## 🔥 What's Next?

### Option 1: Quick Verification (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/sergio/dev/sdd-archtecture
# Check all files created
ls -1 README_NEW.md INTEGRATION_*.md EXECUTION_*.md MIGRATION_MAP.md PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md
# Should show 14 files
```

### Option 2: Proceed to Phase 2 (15 min)
Follow MIGRATION_MAP.md:
```bash
# 1. Create directories
mkdir -p INTEGRATION/templates EXECUTION/docs EXECUTION/tests docs/audit

# 2. Move files
mv templates/* INTEGRATION/templates/
mv docs/ia/* EXECUTION/docs/ia/
mv tests/spec_validation/* EXECUTION/tests/
# (etc.)

# 3. Archive old docs
# (move to docs/audit/)

# 4. Replace README
mv README_NEW.md README.md

# 5. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: Implement two-flow architecture (INTEGRATION/EXECUTION)"
```

### Option 3: Validate Structure First (10 min)
```bash
# Check that new docs are readable
head -20 INTEGRATION_README.md
head -20 EXECUTION_START_HERE.md
head -20 MIGRATION_MAP.md

# All should show clear documentation
```
