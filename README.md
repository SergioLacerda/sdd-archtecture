## 🎯 What is SDD?

**SDD = Specification-Driven Development with Autonomous Governance**

A complete framework for building software where:
- ✅ **AI agents are first-class citizens** — Not afterthoughts, integral to workflow
- ✅ **Governance is automated** — Rules enforced via code, not meetings
- ✅ **Every decision is documented** — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- ✅ **Developers are autonomous** — Clear rules, then get out of the way
- ✅ **Quality is measurable** — 45+ definition-of-done criteria
- ✅ **Scaling is seamless** — From 1 project to 100+ projects

---

## 🗺️ Project Organization

**Everything in this framework is organized into clear flows:**

- **INTEGRATION/:** Adding projects to the framework (30 min)
- **EXECUTION/:** Developing with the framework (ongoing)
- **context/:** Framework history & decisions (reference)

---

## 🎯 Step 0: Choose Your Adoption Path

**Before you start, pick ONE:**

### 🟢 LITE (15 min setup) — Learning & Small Teams
- ✅ 10 core principles
- ✅ 5 essential rules  
- ✅ 10 DoD criteria
- ✅ Perfect for: Learning, side projects, < 5 people
- ✅ Upgrade to FULL anytime (30 min migration)

→ **[LITE-ADOPTION.md](./EXECUTION/spec/guides/adoption/LITE-ADOPTION.md)**

### 🔵 FULL (40 min setup) — Production & Mission-Critical
- ✅ 15 complete principles
- ✅ 16 mandatory rules
- ✅ 45 DoD criteria + 7-phase workflow
- ✅ Perfect for: Production teams, regulatory, autonomous agents
- ✅ Real metrics & governance automation

→ **[FULL-ADOPTION.md](./EXECUTION/spec/guides/adoption/FULL-ADOPTION.md)**

**👉 Unsure?** Start with [adoption/INDEX.md](./EXECUTION/spec/guides/adoption/INDEX.md) — decision tree + comparison table

---

## 🚀 Quick Start — After Choosing Adoption Path

**Decision Tree:**

### 🔷 **Are you adding a NEW project to SDD?**
Yes → **[INTEGRATION/](./INTEGRATION/)** (30 minutes, 5 steps) + your chosen adoption path

### 🔷 **Are you developing a feature/bug/improvement?**
Yes → **[EXECUTION/](./EXECUTION/)** (ongoing, 7-phase workflow with your adoption level)

### 🔷 **Are you an AI agent?**
Yes → **[.ai-index.md](./.ai-index.md)** (machine-readable entry point)

### 🔷 **Need to understand agent governance rules?**
Yes → **[.github/copilot-instructions.md](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)** (AI governance protocol)

### Two Isolated Flows

| INTEGRATION | EXECUTION |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Purpose:** Add projects | **Purpose:** Develop code |
| **Time:** 30 minutes | **Time:** 40 min setup + ongoing |
| **Users:** Project leads | **Users:** Developers, agents |
| **Docs:** [INTEGRATION/](./INTEGRATION/) | **Docs:** [EXECUTION/](./EXECUTION/) |
| **Goal:** Framework ready | **Goal:** Feature implemented |

### Constitutional Layer

- **15 immutable principles** ([constitution.md](./EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/constitution.md))
- **16 mandatory rules** ([ia-rules.md](./EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md))
- **6 Architecture Decision Records** ([ADR-*](./EXECUTION/spec/CANONICAL/decisions/))

### Current Implementation: Python + FastAPI

**SDD v2.1 is built specifically for:**
- ✅ **Python 3.11+** (async-first design)
- ✅ **FastAPI** microservices architecture  
- ✅ **Production-grade** async/await patterns
- ✅ **AI-ready** governance framework

**Core Principles are Language-Agnostic:**
While the current implementation targets Python/FastAPI, the underlying principles are designed to be language-independent:
- Clean Architecture (8 layers)
- Async-first, event-driven design
- Ports & Adapters pattern
- Constitutional governance

**Future Roadmap:**
- ⏳ v3.0: Multi-language support (planned)
  - `sdd-nodejs/` — Express/Fastify + async
  - `sdd-go/` — Gin + goroutines
  - `sdd-rust/` — Tokio + async

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-First Design
- Every decision documented for LLM consumption
- Agents can operate autonomously with clear rules
- No ambiguous "best practices" — rules are explicit

### �️ Flexible Governance
- **LITE**: 10 principles + 5 rules + 10 DoD (entry point)
- **FULL**: 15 principles + 16 rules + 45 DoD (production)
- Start simple, upgrade when ready
- Same architecture patterns, different enforcement levels

### 🏗️ Hierarchical Governance
1. **Constitutional Layer** — Immutable (never changes)
2. **Rules Layer** — Mandatory (5 in LITE, 16 in FULL)
3. **Architecture Layer** — Decisions (recorded why)
4. **Specifications Layer** — How-to (practical patterns)
5. **Guides Layer** — Operational (step-by-step)
6. **Custom Layer** — Project-specific (personalization)

### ✅ Built-in Quality
- Definition of Done: 10 criteria (LITE) or 45+ (FULL)
- Architecture compliance tests
- Import structure validation
- Pre-commit hooks for governance
- Automated setup (15 min for LITE, 40 min for FULL)

### 🎯 What We're Optimizing For
- **Clarity:** No ambiguous "best practices" — rules are explicit
- **Autonomy:** Developers operate confidently, less review overhead
- **Auditability:** Every decision documented for agents + humans
- **Scalability:** Works from 3-person to 300+ person teams

*(Real metrics coming in v2.2 — we're tracking but not publishing yet)*
