## 🤖 CLI Usage

The SDD framework includes a powerful CLI for governance management built with Typer and PyInstaller.

### Installation & Setup

**Option 1: Use the Pre-built Binary (Recommended)**
```bash
# The binary is at: ./dist/sdd (20MB standalone executable)
# It requires NO Python installation

# Make it executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x ./dist/sdd

# Add to PATH (optional)
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/dist
```

**Option 2: Install from Source**
```bash
# Requires Python 3.11+
pip install -r requirements-cli.txt

# Run via Python module
python -m sdd_cli --help
```

### Available Commands

#### 1. **Load Governance Configuration**
```bash
sdd governance load

# Output: Displays current governance configuration
# Shows: Core items (immutable) + Client items (customizable)
```

#### 2. **Validate Governance**
```bash
sdd governance validate

# Output: Validates governance integrity
# Checks: Fingerprints, file structure, compliance
```

#### 3. **Generate Agent Seeds**
```bash
sdd governance generate

# Output: Generates agent seed knowledge files
# Supports: Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Generic AI agents
```

#### 4. **Check Version**
```bash
sdd version

# Output: Current framework version
```

### Examples

```bash
# Get help on any command
sdd --help
sdd governance --help

# Run full governance workflow
sdd governance load
sdd governance validate
sdd governance generate

# Check what version is running
sdd version
```

### What Each Command Does

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `sdd governance load` | Load + display governance config | 155 total items (4 core + 151 customizable) |
| `sdd governance validate` | Validate integrity + checksums | Fingerprint verification results |
| `sdd governance generate` | Create agent seed templates | 3 templates (Cursor, Copilot, Generic) |
| `sdd version` | Show framework version | Current version number |

### Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: sdd"**
- Make sure binary is in PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/dist`
- Or use full path: `./dist/sdd --help`

**"Permission denied"**
- Binary needs execute permission: `chmod +x ./dist/sdd`

**Python version too old**
- Ensure Python 3.11+: `python --version`
- Or use pre-built binary (no Python needed)

## 🎯 What is SDD?

**SDD = Specification-Driven Development with Autonomous Governance**

A complete framework for building software where:
- ✅ **AI agents are first-class citizens** — Not afterthoughts, integral to workflow
- ✅ **Governance is automated** — Rules enforced via code, not meetings
- ✅ **Every decision is documented** — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- ✅ **Developers are autonomous** — Clear rules, then get out of the way
- ✅ **Quality is measurable** — 45+ definition-of-done criteria
- ✅ **Scaling is seamless** — From 1 project to 100+ projects

---

## 🗺️ Project Organization

**Everything in this framework is organized into clear namespaces:**

## ✨ Core Principles

### Two-File Governance Model
- **governance-core.json** (4 immutable items) — Never changes
- **governance-client.json** (151 customizable items) — Adapt to your needs
- SHA-256 fingerprinting ensures integrity
- Salt strategy prevents tampering

### 45+ Definition of Done Criteria
- Code quality checkpoints
- Architecture compliance rules
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Security validation

### 8 Architecture Layers
1. Interface (HTTP/gRPC)
2. Controllers (Request handling)
3. Services (Business logic)
4. Repository (Data access)
5. Models (Domain objects)
6. Adapters (External integrations)
7. Config (Settings management)
8. Infrastructure (Deployment)
