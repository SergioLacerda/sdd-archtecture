## 🎯 What is SDD?

**SDD = Specification-Driven Development with Autonomous Governance**

A complete framework for building software where:
- ✅ **AI agents are first-class citizens** — Not afterthoughts, integral to workflow
- ✅ **Governance is automated** — Rules enforced via code, not meetings
- ✅ **Every decision is documented** — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- ✅ **Developers are autonomous** — Clear rules, then get out of the way
- ✅ **Quality is measurable** — 45+ definition-of-done criteria
- ✅ **Scaling is seamless** — From 1 project to 100+ projects

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Are you:**

### 1️⃣ Starting a New Project?
You want to add this framework to your project (30 minutes).

→ **[INTEGRATION/](./INTEGRATION/)** — 5-step integration checklist

### 2️⃣ Developing a Feature?
You have code to write and want to follow SDD rules.

→ **[EXECUTION/](./EXECUTION/)** — AGENT_HARNESS 7-phase workflow

### 3️⃣ An AI Agent?
You need to understand the framework and start working.

→ **[.ai-index.md](./.ai-index.md)** — AI learning seed (structured for LLMs)

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Two Isolated Flows

| INTEGRATION | EXECUTION |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Purpose:** Add projects | **Purpose:** Develop code |
| **Time:** 30 minutes | **Time:** 40 min setup + ongoing |
| **Users:** Project leads | **Users:** Developers, agents |
| **Docs:** [INTEGRATION/](./INTEGRATION/) | **Docs:** [EXECUTION/](./EXECUTION/) |
| **Goal:** Framework ready | **Goal:** Feature implemented |

### Constitutional Layer

- **15 immutable principles** ([constitution.md](./EXECUTION/docs/ia/CANONICAL/rules/constitution.md))
- **16 mandatory rules** ([ia-rules.md](./EXECUTION/docs/ia/CANONICAL/rules/ia-rules.md))
- **6 Architecture Decision Records** ([ADR-*](./EXECUTION/docs/ia/CANONICAL/decisions/))

### Technology-Agnostic

Works with:
- ✅ Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#...
- ✅ Monoliths, microservices, serverless
- ✅ Web, mobile, ML, infrastructure
- ✅ Sync and async codebases

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-First Design
- Every decision documented for LLM consumption
- Agents can operate autonomously with clear rules
- No ambiguous "best practices" — rules are explicit

### 🏗️ Hierarchical Governance
1. **Constitutional Layer** — Immutable (never changes)
2. **Rules Layer** — Mandatory (always followed)
3. **Architecture Layer** — Decisions (recorded why)
4. **Specifications Layer** — How-to (practical patterns)
5. **Guides Layer** — Operational (step-by-step)
6. **Custom Layer** — Project-specific (personalization)

### ✅ Built-in Quality
- Definition of Done: 45+ criteria
- Architecture compliance tests
- Import structure validation
- Pre-commit hooks for governance
- Automated PHASE 0 setup

### 📊 Measurable Outcomes
- **First PR approval:** 90%+ (clear rules = fewer reviews)
- **Implementation time:** -30% (no ambiguity)
- **Knowledge retention:** 100% (documented decisions)
- **Scaling difficulty:** Linear (not exponential)
